```{r setup}
library(ASAPI)
library(jsonlite)

Sys.setenv("api_key"="as135as")

email = "tomasacuna@agrospace.cl"
password = "as1234"
auth = asapi_auth(email = email,password = password)


```

## AgroSpace API


```{r cars}
print(auth)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
